# Al3xis-Bot-dev

Al3xis is a bot developed by **Alex22#7756** (Discord username). This bot has some moderation and common commands, use `a!help` and `a!info` for more information about the bot.
If you have a suggestion for my bot you can use the command `a!suggest` and if you've found a bug, issue, you can join my Discord server to report the bug or report it directly with `a!report`; you can get the `Contributor` role if you help me reporting/fixing issues.
I use [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) to host this bot which in my opinion, is a good free host for Discord bots.
