# Al3xis-Bot-dev

This is a bot with some moderation and utility commands but we are thinking on adding new commands soon, we already have the project of add reaction commands and announce commands which will be available in a feature.
The bot is developed with python.
We use heroku to host our bot which in my opinion, is a good free host for bots.
