# Al3xis-Bot-dev

Al3xis is a bot developed by **Alex22#7756** (Discord username). This bot has some moderation and common commands. 
If you have some suggestion for our bot you can use the command a!suggest. This is a public bot but will not be online all the time (at least not yet).
I use [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) to host this bot which in my opinion, is a good free host for Discord bots.

You can join my Discord server if you have any question.
